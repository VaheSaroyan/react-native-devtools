## 📦 Installation

### DevTools Desktop Application (macOS)

> **⚠️ Important**: The desktop app has currently only been tested on Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3).
> If you encounter issues on Intel-based Macs, please [open an issue](https://github.com/LovesWorking/rn-better-dev-tools/issues)
> and we'll work together to fix it.

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/LovesWorking/rn-better-dev-tools/releases)
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Move the app to your Applications folder
4. Launch the app

### React Application Integration

The easiest way to connect your React application to the DevTools is by installing the npm package:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install --save-dev react-native-devtools-sync socket.io-client

# Using yarn
yarn add -D react-native-devtools-sync socket.io-client

# Using pnpm
pnpm add -D react-native-devtools-sync socket.io-client
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Launch React Native DevTools application
2. Add the hook to your application where you set up your React Query context:

```jsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { useSyncQueriesExternal } from "react-query-external-sync";
// Import Platform for React Native or use other platform detection for web/desktop
import { Platform } from "react-native";

// Create your query client
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <AppContent />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}

function AppContent() {
  // Set up the sync hook - automatically disabled in production!
  useSyncQueriesExternal({
    queryClient,
    socketURL: "http://localhost:42831", // Default port for React Native DevTools
    deviceName: Platform?.OS || "web", // Platform detection
    platform: Platform?.OS || "web", // Use appropriate platform identifier
    deviceId: Platform?.OS || "web", // Use a PERSISTENT identifier (see note below)
    extraDeviceInfo: {
      // Optional additional info about your device
      appVersion: "1.0.0",
      // Add any relevant platform info
    },
    enableLogs: false,
  });

  // Your app content
  return <YourApp />;
}
```

3. Start your React application
4. DevTools will automatically detect and connect to your running application

### 📱 Using with Real Devices (Local Network)

When testing on real devices connected to your local network, you'll need to use your host machine's IP address instead of `localhost`. Here's a helpful setup for Expo apps (contributed by [ShoeBoom](https://github.com/ShoeBoom)):

```jsx
import Constants from "expo-constants";

// Get the host IP address dynamically
const hostIP =
  Constants.expoGoConfig?.debuggerHost?.split(`:`)[0] ||
  Constants.expoConfig?.hostUri?.split(`:`)[0];

function AppContent() {
  useSyncQueriesExternal({
    queryClient,
    socketURL: `http://${hostIP}:42831`, // Use local network IP
    deviceName: Platform?.OS || "web",
    platform: Platform?.OS || "web",
    deviceId: Platform?.OS || "web",
    extraDeviceInfo: {
      appVersion: "1.0.0",
    },
    enableLogs: false,
  });

  return <YourApp />;
}
```

> **Note**: For optimal connection, launch DevTools before starting your application.

## 💡 Usage Tips

- Keep DevTools running while developing
- Monitor query states in real-time
- View detailed query information
- Track cache updates and invalidations
- The hook is automatically disabled in production builds, no configuration needed

## 📱 Platform Support

React Native DevTools works with **any React-based application**, regardless of platform:

- 📱 Mobile: iOS, Android
- 🖥️ Web: React, Next.js, Remix, etc.
- 🖥️ Desktop: Electron, Tauri
- 📺 TV: tvOS, Android TV
- 🥽 VR/AR: Meta Quest, etc.
- 💻 Cross-platform: Expo, React Native Web

If your platform can run React and connect to a socket server, it will work with these DevTools!

## ✅ Implemented Features

React Native DevTools has successfully implemented the following features:

- 📊 **Storage Viewers**: Beautiful interfaces for viewing and modifying AsyncStorage
- 🌐 **Network Request Monitoring**: Track API calls, WebSockets, and GraphQL requests
- ❌ **Failed Request Tracking**: Easily identify and debug network failures
- 🔄 **Remote Expo DevTools**: Trigger Expo DevTools commands remotely without using the command line

## 🔮 Future Plans

React Native DevTools is actively being developed with exciting features on the roadmap:

- 🧩 **Plugin System**: Allow community extensions for specialized debugging tasks
- 📊 **Additional Storage Viewers**: Support for MMKV and other storage solutions
- 🔌 **Enhanced Network Monitoring**: More detailed network request analysis
- 🧪 **Test Runner Integration**: Run and monitor tests directly from DevTools
- drizzle-studio-plugin

Stay tuned for updates!

## 🚀 Remote Expo DevTools

The newly implemented Remote Expo DevTools feature allows you to trigger Expo DevTools commands remotely without using the command line. This makes it easier to debug and test your Expo applications.

### Available Commands

- **Reload**: Reload your app instantly
- **Toggle Inspector**: Enable/disable the element inspector
- **Toggle Performance Monitor**: Show/hide the performance monitor
- **Toggle Element Inspector**: Enable/disable the element inspector
- **Clear Cache**: Clear the app's cache
- **Toggle Remote Debugging**: Enable/disable remote debugging
- **Open Dev Menu**: Open the developer menu
- **Take Screenshot**: Capture a screenshot of your app
- **Shake Device**: Simulate device shake

### How to Use

1. Enable Expo DevTools in your app:

```jsx
useSyncQueriesExternal({
  // ... other options
  expoDevTools: {
    enabled: true
  }
});
```

2. Implement the command handlers in your app:

```jsx
import { 
  setExpoCommandImplementations,
  useSyncQueriesExternal 
} from "react-query-external-sync";

// Implement the command handlers
setExpoCommandImplementations({
  reload: async () => {
    // Implement reload functionality
    // For example: await Updates.reloadAsync();
  },
  toggleInspector: async () => {
    // Implement toggle inspector functionality
    // For example: DevSettings.toggleElementInspector();
  },
  // ... other implementations
});
```

3. Use the DevTools UI to trigger commands remotely:
   - Connect to your device
   - Click the Expo DevTools button in the dashboard
   - Select a command to execute remotely

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

Having issues? Check these common solutions:

1. **App Not Connecting**

   - Ensure DevTools is launched before your React app
   - Check that your React app is running
   - Verify you're on the same network
   - Make sure the `socketURL` is correctly pointing to localhost:42831
   - Verify the Socket.IO client is properly installed in your app
   - Check that the `useSyncQueriesExternal` hook is properly implemented

2. **App Not Starting**

   - Verify you're using the latest version
   - Check system requirements (macOS with Apple Silicon chip)
   - Try reinstalling the application
   - If using an Intel Mac and encountering issues, please report them

3. **Socket Connection Issues**

   - Make sure no firewall is blocking the connection on port 42831
   - Restart both the DevTools app and your React app
   - Check the console logs with `enableLogs: true` for any error messages
   - If the React Query data is too large the socket connection will crash! If you see the device connect and then disconnect with no logs this is what's happening. You'll need to fix your query cache to not be so large.

4. **Data Not Syncing**

   - Confirm you're passing the correct `queryClient` instance
   - Set `enableLogs: true` to see connection information

5. **Device ID Issues**
   - Make sure your `deviceId` is persistent (see below)

## ⚠️ Important Note About Device IDs

The `deviceId` parameter must be **persistent** across app restarts and re-renders. Using a value that changes (like `Date.now()`) will cause each render to be treated as a new device.

**Recommended approaches:**

```jsx
// Simple approach for single devices
deviceId: Platform.OS, // Works if you only have one device per platform

// Better approach for multiple simulators/devices of same type
// Using AsyncStorage, MMKV, or another storage solution
const [deviceId, setDeviceId] = useState(Platform.OS);

useEffect(() => {
  const loadOrCreateDeviceId = async () => {
    // Try to load existing ID
    const storedId = await AsyncStorage.getItem('deviceId');

    if (storedId) {
      setDeviceId(storedId);
    } else {
      // First launch - generate and store a persistent ID
      const newId = `${Platform.OS}-${Date.now()}`;
      await AsyncStorage.setItem('deviceId', newId);
      setDeviceId(newId);
    }
  };

  loadOrCreateDeviceId();
}, []);
```
