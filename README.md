## 📦 Installation

### DevTools Desktop Application (macOS)

> **⚠️ Important**: The desktop app has currently only been tested on Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3).
> If you encounter issues on Intel-based Macs, please [open an issue](https://github.com/LovesWorking/rn-better-dev-tools/issues)
> and we'll work together to fix it.

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/LovesWorking/rn-better-dev-tools/releases)
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Move the app to your Applications folder
4. Launch the app

### React Application Integration

The easiest way to connect your React application to the DevTools is by installing the npm package:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install --save-dev react-query-external-sync socket.io-client

# Using yarn
yarn add -D react-query-external-sync socket.io-client

# Using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm add -D react-query-external-sync socket.io-client
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Launch React Native DevTools application
2. Add the hook to your application where you set up your React Query context:

```jsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { useSyncQueriesExternal } from "react-query-external-sync";
// Import Platform for React Native or use other platform detection for web/desktop
import { Platform } from "react-native";

// Create your query client
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <AppContent />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}

function AppContent() {
  // Set up the sync hook - automatically disabled in production!
  useSyncQueriesExternal({
    queryClient,
    socketURL: "http://localhost:42831", // Default port for React Native DevTools
    deviceName: Platform?.OS || "web", // Platform detection
    platform: Platform?.OS || "web", // Use appropriate platform identifier
    deviceId: Platform?.OS || "web", // Use a PERSISTENT identifier (see note below)
    extraDeviceInfo: {
      // Optional additional info about your device
      appVersion: "1.0.0",
      // Add any relevant platform info
    },
    enableLogs: false,
  });

  // Your app content
  return <YourApp />;
}
```

3. Start your React application
4. DevTools will automatically detect and connect to your running application

### 📱 Using with Real Devices (Local Network)

When testing on real devices connected to your local network, you'll need to use your host machine's IP address instead of `localhost`. Here's a helpful setup for Expo apps (contributed by [ShoeBoom](https://github.com/ShoeBoom)):

```jsx
import Constants from "expo-constants";

// Get the host IP address dynamically
const hostIP =
  Constants.expoGoConfig?.debuggerHost?.split(`:`)[0] ||
  Constants.expoConfig?.hostUri?.split(`:`)[0];

function AppContent() {
  useSyncQueriesExternal({
    queryClient,
    socketURL: `http://${hostIP}:42831`, // Use local network IP
    deviceName: Platform?.OS || "web",
    platform: Platform?.OS || "web",
    deviceId: Platform?.OS || "web",
    extraDeviceInfo: {
      appVersion: "1.0.0",
    },
    enableLogs: false,
  });

  return <YourApp />;
}
```

> **Note**: For optimal connection, launch DevTools before starting your application.

## 💡 Usage Tips

- Keep DevTools running while developing
- Monitor query states in real-time
- View detailed query information
- Track cache updates and invalidations
- The hook is automatically disabled in production builds, no configuration needed

## 📱 Platform Support

React Native DevTools works with **any React-based application**, regardless of platform:

- 📱 Mobile: iOS, Android
- 🖥️ Web: React, Next.js, Remix, etc.
- 🖥️ Desktop: Electron, Tauri
- 📺 TV: tvOS, Android TV
- 🥽 VR/AR: Meta Quest, etc.
- 💻 Cross-platform: Expo, React Native Web

If your platform can run React and connect to a socket server, it will work with these DevTools!

## 🔮 Future Plans

React Native DevTools is actively being developed with exciting features on the roadmap:

- 📊 **Storage Viewers**: Beautiful interfaces for viewing and modifying storage (AsyncStorage, MMKV, etc.)
- 🌐 **Network Request Monitoring**: Track API calls, WebSockets, and GraphQL requests
- ❌ **Failed Request Tracking**: Easily identify and debug network failures
- 🔄 **Remote Expo DevTools**: Trigger Expo DevTools commands remotely without using the command line
- 🧩 **Plugin System**: Allow community extensions for specialized debugging tasks
- drizzle-studio-plugin

Stay tuned for updates!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

Having issues? Check these common solutions:

1. **App Not Connecting**

   - Ensure DevTools is launched before your React app
   - Check that your React app is running
   - Verify you're on the same network
   - Make sure the `socketURL` is correctly pointing to localhost:42831
   - Verify the Socket.IO client is properly installed in your app
   - Check that the `useSyncQueriesExternal` hook is properly implemented

2. **App Not Starting**

   - Verify you're using the latest version
   - Check system requirements (macOS with Apple Silicon chip)
   - Try reinstalling the application
   - If using an Intel Mac and encountering issues, please report them

3. **Socket Connection Issues**

   - Make sure no firewall is blocking the connection on port 42831
   - Restart both the DevTools app and your React app
   - Check the console logs with `enableLogs: true` for any error messages

4. **Data Not Syncing**

   - Confirm you're passing the correct `queryClient` instance
   - Set `enableLogs: true` to see connection information

5. **Device ID Issues**
   - Make sure your `deviceId` is persistent (see below)

## ⚠️ Important Note About Device IDs

The `deviceId` parameter must be **persistent** across app restarts and re-renders. Using a value that changes (like `Date.now()`) will cause each render to be treated as a new device.

**Recommended approaches:**

```jsx
// Simple approach for single devices
deviceId: Platform.OS, // Works if you only have one device per platform

// Better approach for multiple simulators/devices of same type
// Using AsyncStorage, MMKV, or another storage solution
const [deviceId, setDeviceId] = useState(Platform.OS);

useEffect(() => {
  const loadOrCreateDeviceId = async () => {
    // Try to load existing ID
    const storedId = await AsyncStorage.getItem('deviceId');

    if (storedId) {
      setDeviceId(storedId);
    } else {
      // First launch - generate and store a persistent ID
      const newId = `${Platform.OS}-${Date.now()}`;
      await AsyncStorage.setItem('deviceId', newId);
      setDeviceId(newId);
    }
  };

  loadOrCreateDeviceId();
}, []);
```
